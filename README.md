# blood-pressure-simulation
Arduino-based Blood Pressure Simulation System that inflates a BP cuff, detects pulse signals using a microphone sensor, and mimics heartbeat sounds via a buzzer. After detecting a pulse, it displays a simulated 120/80 mmHg reading. Ideal for medical simulations, DIY projects, and educational demonstrations.
